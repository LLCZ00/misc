# Miscellaneous Projects
I don't think these need their own repo, but I still find them occasionally useful, so they're saved here.<br/>They're in varying degrees of development.
## printHex.py
A hexdump clone, but not as good.
#### To do/Issues
1. Fails when given a file less than 8 bytes
2. Add function to return strings
## malwareToolsWIN10.ps1
Powershell script to download common malware analysis tools for Windows 10.

## segmentCalculator.py
Calculates the physical address of a memory segment e.g. 07c0:0 = 0x7c00
#### To do/Issues
1. Probably needs to be expanded upon
## cmtBlock.py
Takes a string via command line and outputs it surrounded by the given/default (#) character.
Used to make square 'block' comments in a style of my own personal preference.
```
###########
# Example #
###########
```
#### To do/Issues
1. Expand to accept "languages" as arguments, and use the character of that languages comments.
